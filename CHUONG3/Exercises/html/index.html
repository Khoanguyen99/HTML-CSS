        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of
            directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and
            entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:
            <!--Tag dùng để trích dẫn -->
            <blockquote>
                "Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of
                knowledge...and
                that is priceless."
            </blockquote>
